# Kimberly Hotels
### Experience Unparalleled Comfort

A Dynamic website designed with HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and JavaScript.

### ABSTRACT

This project concentrates on building a website for a hotel. The website is based on HTML, CSS and JavaScript. It focuses on giving the customer all the information about the hotel and its services. The website gives details of rooms with pictures and also supports a customer feedback system. Many hotel websites do not have a proper feedback or customer grievances redressal forms. Our project aims at developing the customer support mechanism.

### INTRODUCTION

During the past several decades Hotel function and information has been transformed from a relatively obscure printed banners and manual customer service to central and top-level management functional web application-based system. There are many factors that have influenced this transformation like technological advances, professionalism, and general recognition of human beings as most important resources.

A computer-based management system is designed to handle all the primary information required to display room information etc. A list of all the services and amenities are some of the things that attract the user/customer. This project intends to introduce more user friendliness in the various activities such as searching for hotel, booking a room, customer feedback and getting the location of the hotel. The entire feedback information will be mailed to the hotel admin for further response generation.

This project explores various aspects of requirements of a website for hotel and tries to go a step further by giving the visitors a sense of being welcomed. The goal of any project is to establish an interactive user interface that is user(visitor) friendly, and that goal is met here in this project. This project is majorly based on HTML, CSS, JavaScript.

### METHODOLOGY

a. HTML :
Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language for creating web pages and web applications. With Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and JavaScript, it forms a triad of cornerstone technologies for the World Wide Web. Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the document.

b. CSS. :
Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language like HTML.CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript. CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, including layout, colors, and fonts. This separation can improve content accessibility, provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics, enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, and reduce complexity and repetition in the structural content.

c. JavaScript :
As a multi-paradigm language, JavaScript supports event-driven, functional, and imperative (including object-oriented and prototype-based) programming styles. It has an API for working with text, arrays, dates, regular expressions, and basic manipulation of the DOM, but the language itself does not include any I/O, such as networking, storage, or graphics facilities, relying for these upon the host environment in which it is embedded.

Initially only implemented client-side in web browsers, JavaScript engines are now embedded in many other types of host software, including server-side in web servers and databases, and in non-web programs such as word processors and PDF software, and in runtime environments that make JavaScript available for writing mobile and desktop applications, including desktop widgets.
